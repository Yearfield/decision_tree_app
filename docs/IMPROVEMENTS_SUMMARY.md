# Decision Tree App Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the three major improvements implemented to enhance the decision tree application.

## 1. Workspace KPI Correctness (Parents with 5 Children)

### Problem
The workspace coverage metrics were using ad-hoc logic that didn't accurately reflect the true parent counts and coverage status.

### Solution
Replaced the ad-hoc logic with the robust indexer functions:
- **Before**: Used `infer_branch_options()` with manual parsing and counting
- **After**: Uses `build_parent_child_index()` â†’ `summarize_children_sets()` for accurate metrics

### Implementation Details

#### Level 1 (ROOT) Coverage
- **Parent Count**: Always 1 (ROOT)
- **Covered**: When `summary[(1, "<ROOT>")]["exact5"] == True`
- **Logic**: Single parent with exactly 5 children

#### Levels 2+ Coverage
- **Parent Count**: Number of distinct parent paths detected at that level
- **Covered**: Parents where `exact5 == True`
- **Logic**: Each unique parent path counts as one parent

### Benefits
- âœ… **Accurate Counts**: Reflects real parent counts, not inflated by row duplication
- âœ… **Consistent Logic**: Uses the same robust indexer as the conflicts tab
- âœ… **Real-time Updates**: Nonce-aware caching ensures fresh metrics
- âœ… **Performance**: Single computation pass for all metrics

## 2. Duplicate Rows Policy (Explicit Documentation)

### Problem
The app's handling of duplicate rows was implicit and could lead to confusion about how conflicts and coverage are calculated.

### Solution
Added explicit policy documentation in code comments and UI notes across all relevant files.

### Policy Statement
```
"This app treats each row as a full path. Duplicate prefixes (first N nodes) are expected; 
we compute unique children per parent by set semantics. Downstream multiplication does not 
inflate child counts.

The indexer maintains counters for display purposes but uses unique labels to judge 
child-set size and conflicts. This ensures accurate conflict detection regardless of 
row duplication patterns."
```

### Implementation Locations
- **`logic/tree.py`**: Core logic documentation
- **`ui/tabs/conflicts.py`**: Conflicts tab documentation + UI expandable info
- **`ui/tabs/workspace.py`**: Workspace tab documentation

### Benefits
- âœ… **Clear Understanding**: Users know what to expect from duplicate rows
- âœ… **Consistent Behavior**: All tabs follow the same policy
- âœ… **Accurate Metrics**: Counters are maintained for display, but conflicts judged by unique labels
- âœ… **Developer Clarity**: Code comments explain the expected behavior

## 3. Majority-Vote Canonical Set Helper

### Problem
Users had to manually select children for custom canonical sets without guidance on what might be the "best" choice.

### Solution
Added `majority_vote_5set()` helper function that suggests canonical sets based on frequency analysis.

### Implementation

```python
def majority_vote_5set(variants: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:
    """
    Suggest a canonical 5-set per (level, parent_label) by majority vote across parents sharing that label.
    """
    if not variants:
        return []
    
    # Flatten all children and count frequencies
    flat = [c for vs in variants for c in vs]
    freq = Counter(flat)
    
    # Rank by frequency (descending) then alphabetically
    ranked = [c for c, _ in freq.most_common()]
    
    # Apply normalization (dedupe, cap to 5)
    return normalize_child_set(ranked)
```

### UI Integration
- **Pre-fills Custom Canonical Set**: Suggests children based on majority vote
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows suggested set with ðŸ’¡ icon
- **Smart Defaults**: Users can start with the suggestion and modify as needed

### Benefits
- âœ… **Intelligent Suggestions**: Data-driven recommendations for canonical sets
- âœ… **User Experience**: Reduces manual selection effort
- âœ… **Consistency**: Suggests sets that are most representative of existing data
- âœ… **Flexibility**: Users can still customize the suggested set

## Technical Implementation Details

### Cache Strategy
- **TTL**: 600 seconds (10 minutes) for reasonable performance
- **Nonce Awareness**: Uses `get_wb_nonce()` to invalidate cache when data changes
- **No Spinner**: Prevents UI blocking during cache computation

### Data Flow
1. **Input**: DataFrame + nonce
2. **Processing**: Build index â†’ Summarize â†’ Find mismatches â†’ Count metrics
3. **Output**: Structured data for UI consumption
4. **UI Updates**: Real-time refresh with cache invalidation

### Integration Points
- **State Management**: Uses `get_wb_nonce()`, `set_active_workbook()`, `set_current_sheet()`
- **Tree Logic**: Leverages robust indexer functions for consistent behavior
- **Override System**: Integrates with existing `build_raw_plus_v630()` pipeline
- **UI Utilities**: Uses `safe_rerun()` for state updates

## Testing and Validation

### Compilation Tests
- âœ… `logic/tree.py` - All functions compile correctly
- âœ… `ui/tabs/conflicts.py` - Conflicts tab compiles correctly
- âœ… `ui/tabs/workspace.py` - Workspace tab compiles correctly

### Functionality Tests
- âœ… Cached conflict summary works correctly
- âœ… Majority vote helper produces expected results
- âœ… Coverage metrics use robust indexer
- âœ… Duplicate rows policy is documented consistently

## Benefits Summary

1. **Accuracy**: KPI metrics now reflect real parent counts and coverage status
2. **Consistency**: All tabs use the same robust indexer for tree analysis
3. **Performance**: Cached computation prevents redundant analysis
4. **User Experience**: Clear policy documentation and intelligent suggestions
5. **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns and reusable components
6. **Real-time Updates**: Nonce-aware caching ensures fresh data display

## Future Enhancements

1. **Conflict History**: Track resolution actions over time
2. **Bulk Operations**: Resolve multiple conflicts simultaneously
3. **Validation Rules**: Custom business rule validation
4. **Export/Import**: Save/load conflict resolution configurations
5. **Performance Metrics**: Track resolution time and success rates
6. **Advanced Suggestions**: Machine learning-based canonical set recommendations

## Conclusion

These improvements significantly enhance the decision tree application by:
- Providing accurate, real-time coverage metrics
- Clearly documenting the expected behavior for duplicate rows
- Offering intelligent suggestions for conflict resolution
- Maintaining consistency across all UI components
- Improving performance through intelligent caching

The application now provides a robust, user-friendly, and performant interface for managing decision tree conflicts and coverage while maintaining clear expectations about data handling.
